## Abstract:
The real world is **DIRTY**! There’s too much garbage everywhere, but cleaning is such a **CHORE**! So our *“utopia”* world is a place where everyone does the cleaning for us *(the developers)*. But of course, they won’t go unrewarded, after organizing every painstaking nook and cranny within a restricted time limit, they will be granted the best kind of reward, *prestige*. The opportunity of claiming the *very honorable title* “Grime Buster!”.
